                <h2>Raw Versus Controlled Gender Wage Gap</h2>
                <p>When comparing the median salary between men and women, a 2021 report from Payscale reports that women earn 82 cents for every dollar men make. This 18% difference is the raw gender pay gap. However, when accounting for other factors besides gender, such as in education, experience, location, and industry, the gender wage gap shrinks dramatically to just a 2% difference. So the controlled gender pay gap means that women are making 98 cents for every dollar men make.</p>

                    <p>The effect of a pay disparity gets compounded over time. So making 2% less for a few years may not be that much money. Yet over the course of decades, it can amount to a significant difference in money earned.</p>

                <h2>Why the Gender Pay Gap Still Exists</h2>
                <p>In the vast majority of jobs, a pay discrepancy based on gender probably has multiple explanations, many of which fall into one of two categories. An OECD paper referred to these as “glass ceilings” and “sticky floors.” Glass ceilings referred to obstacles that stand in the way of women advancing their careers.  An example might include a woman choosing not to apply for a promotion because she knows she needs to work part-time for caregiving responsibilities. In contrast, sticky floors are disadvantages women consistently face whether they’re just starting their careers or are getting ready to retire. For instance, a boss assumes that women are less competent or qualified in a position, and decides to offer a lower salary when making a job offer.</p>

                <h2>The Effect of the Coronavirus on the Gender Wage Gap</h2>
                <p>The global pandemic we all know as the coronavirus has not done women any favors in terms of reducing the gender wage gap. At first glance, the coronavirus seemed to improve the gender pay gap.  According to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, from 2019 to 2020, the gender wage gap narrowed from 18.5% to 17.7%. But this wasn’t due to women earning more. Rather, it was the result of a disproportionate number of low-wage female workers losing their jobs due to the coronavirus. </p>

                <h2>How to Address to Gender Pay Gap </h2>
                <p>There’s been a lot of talk about how to eliminate the differences in pay between men and women. The solution probably requires a multi-pronged approach, with various policy changes working together. Some of these could include: </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <ul>
                    <li>Employees sharing wage and benefit information with each other.</li>
                    <li>Prohibit employers from using salary history information during the hiring process.</li>
                    <li>Have companies regularly review internal compensation data to ensure there’s no pattern of pay discrepancy between male and female employees.</li>
                    <li>Eliminate salary negotiations.</li>
                    <li>Guarantee worker access to paid time off in the form of paid sick days and paid family and medical leave. The best way to do this is pass federal legislation, like the proposed Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act.</li>
